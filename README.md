This is a basic recipe website following my learning on The Odin Project for Web Development

A summary of what I learned will be added below when I've completed this project.

5-30-24: UPDATE: I am starting over again with Odin project and picking up where I previously left off.
I working on refreshing my memory on what I've already learned and progressing on the stuff that I previously struggled with.
As above, I will update below when the project is completed.
